# TorontoSkyBox_Zaid


Hello!
This Component Framework consists of five projects I did in my Graphics class.
The code is written in C++ language and the IDE I used was Visual Studio 2022.

There are five scenes, each scene is a different project.

#Scene1: Phonge Shading Model, Press F1 key on your keyboard.

Scene2: Trackball, Press F2 key on your keyboard.

Scene3: Reflection Shader, Press F3 key on your keyboard.

Scene4: Refraction Shader, Press F4 key on your keyboard.

Scene5: Noise Perlin, Press F5 key on your keyboard.

All the shaders are different in each scenes. 




Thank you for viewing my projects!
